# iOSTechTest
## Project Brief

Your mission should you chose to accept it is as follows:
##### This document will NOT self destruct after reading it (lack of budget funding)

#Make a Smurf viewer! 

Smurfs! - you say?  Come on…. Everyone ❤️loves❤️ viewing Smurfs… duh.

###Getting started

Please clone this repo and track your commits with git.

Your app should allow the user to browse through our live and ever updating list of Smurfs.

###Web calls

Luckily the Smurf data is very simple and is located at
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bofin/iOSTechTestData/master/SmurfPayload.json`

All images provided to us by the Smurfs are located at: 
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bofin/iOSTechTestData/master/SmurfImages/`

It’s at this point that we promised a shout out to Bernárd our ever suffering intern who lives in the basement. Without him lovingly uploading all the pictures from the tiny blue SmurfCam™, we would have no images to offer our client base. Thanks Bernárd.

###Requirements
- Smurfs are very image conscious and take a lot of time when it comes to presenting themselves; therefore their picture should be prominently visible whilst they are being displayed.
- The Smurfs name should also be displayed in a logical fashion somewhere on the screen.
- Unit tests should be provided for key functionality. 
- Basic DI and (network service with examples) are included to get you off to a quick start

###Extra points!
- Smurfs are extremely forgiving when it comes to what the app looks like - they are more concerned with their own pictures. Basically the point we’re making is that they don’t really mind if your work doesn’t look a piece of fine art :)
- However! They definitely take into consideration how much work you put in, so if you want (and have the time to spare) feel free to try and impress them (and us)!

After speaking with the clients, we have compiled a list of do’s and dont’s that you must consider when it comes to making a regular old Smurf viewer app that can be found in virtually every tiny blue household on the planet.

#####Smurfs hate
- Interface builder/storyboards
- Doing too much work on the UI thread (image loading etc)
- Buggy, untested code
- Unnecessary comments (function and variable names should be descriptive)

#####Smurfs love
- Code simplicity wherever possible 
- Well written, elegantly structured code
- Following swift conventions (naming, capitalisation, etc, etc)
- Unit tests

###Additional

This app is only the beta version so more functionality is still to come. We have estimated it should probably take you about an hour or so to complete stage 1. 

If you run out of time, please don’t feel like you have to finish it. Smurfs will consider all entries regardless of completion… They’re nice like that.

Good luck!
